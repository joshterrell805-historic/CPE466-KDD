\begin{abstract}
  When looking at a graph of data, it can be helpful to find the most
influential nodes. The PageRank algorithm provides a straightforward
way to achieve this. We implemented the PageRank algorithm and ran it
on several datasets.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The PageRank algorithm, developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and initially used in what became the Google search engine, is a technique for calculating the importance of nodes in a graph.



\section{Implementation Overview}
We implemented our reading and writing system in Python, but the bulk of the algorithm in C. The C runs a master thread and a (configurable) number of worker threads. Each thread asks the master thread for a block of data to work on. The data is stored in structs with six fields:
\begin{lstlisting}[lang=ANSI]
{
  id: unsigned int,
  outgoing: unsigned int,
  incoming: [unsigned int],
  nIncoming: unsigned int,
  lRank: double,
  rRank: double,
}
\end{lstlisting}
Multiple passes are used to process the data. On each pass, the
PageRank for each node is read from either the \texttt{lRank} or
\texttt{rRank} field and the new rank is written to the other. If the
rank has changed more than a certain delta, a flag is updated to allow
the system to know the algorithm has not converged. Once all the
worker threads have completed their work, if the ``unconverged'' flag
is set, the master thread starts the workers again, this time telling
them to read from the field they were just writing to and to write to
the field they were reading from.

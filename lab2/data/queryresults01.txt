And I would also point out that this is not the first time measles have shown up in Disneyland. Disneyland is an international destination. People come from all over the world. There is still measles out in the world.

So I wanted to let you know, for those of you who don't already know, being located in Orange County near Disneyland, we did have eight cases of Measles come into our emergency department, children with Measles come into our ED this winter. Five out of the eight were so sick that they needed to be hospitalized.

And what we're seeing there is, you're seeing schools with immunization rates as low as 50% or below and in fact when people have analyzed the measles outbreak that happened to begin in Disneyland.

So when you have a high enough immunization rate, basically, when an exposer shows up, someone shows up with the disease, it doesn't go anywhere. In fact, let's just take Disneyland, for example. This is clearly not the first time someone has shown up to Disneyland with measles. Disneyland is an internationally renowned park. People come from all over the world.

And, this year the Disneyland Measles outbreak infected 134 Californians, as well as other people across the United States, and in Canada, and Mexico. And, it also included 15 infants who were too young to be immunized, here in California.  It hospitalized at least 20 people.

That's what we saw with the Disneyland outbreak, the measles outbreak that started in Disneyland, that's what we saw with the pertussis outbreak, that's why we're doing this bill.

over 9,000 people, hospitalized 809, killed 10 infants, and the Disneyland measles outbreak, which infected 134 Californians including 15 infants too young to be immunized, and hospitalized at least 20 people, have both been linked to communities with low vaccination rates and high use of the personal belief exemption.

But what is different this time, is that the measles didn't just stay in Disneyland and maybe affect a couple of other people who were there. It spread and spread and spread across our state, across our country, even into Canada and a couple of cases in Mexico.

And you had hundreds of hospitalizations from that pertussis outbreak. So, pertussis clearly triggered legislative action. Measles, of course we had the Disneyland outbreak. But don't forget that the year before, in 2013, before the Disneyland outbreak, we had a record 644 cases of measles in the country.

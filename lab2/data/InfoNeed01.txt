I would like to know who among the legislators have been strongly opposed
to the vaccination bill, and specifically, I would like to see
what their arguments were

Huff, Bob (Legislator) Senate
It certainly has saved us from a lot of childhood deaths and other things. But not everything in life is easily accomplished with advancements without trade-offs on the other side. And so, where I am leaning right now and I'll probably vote is against your bill, because I think the trade-off of giving up personal freedoms, even if your child gets sick because of that personal freedom or personal choice, I think that that's a threshold that should be very carefully evaluated before we hand it over to a government mandate.

Now, I want to be clear, I support vaccinations. I support the idea of vaccinating to make California safer. But I also think that law makers have to really weigh that against the individual's freedoms and parental rights.

Waldron, Marie (Legislator) Assembly
And we've forgotten about that, but informed consent is a human right. It's been stated that there is a responsibility in the freedom of choice, and therefore, those choosing to limit vaccines face the consequence of not being able to send their child to school,

Pan, Richard (Legislator) Assembly
Thank you. I'm disappointed that there's some people who don't believe in freedom here, but SB 277 is about freedom. Freedom from deadly, crippling contagions that are now preventable through the science of vaccination. Vaccines are one of the greatest health achievements of mankind.

Chavez, Rocky (Legislator) Assembly
Well thank you very much. I'll just close at this time. Truly this discussion we're having here is not about vaccinations, I think it's about freedom. I think somebody used that in the beginning, it's about freedom. I'm looking at this and trying to figure out, before I impact upon people's freedom, what is the problem? What's the problem we're trying to solve?

Pan, Richard (Legislator) Assembly
I wanna thank the chair and committee staff for your hard work on the bill and we are accepting the proposed committee amendments as described in the analysis. Thank you. SB 277 is about freedom, freedom from deadly crippling contagions.

that Dr. Pan's described it is the fact, if that is not the fact we want to hear from doctors and we would be very interested in changing the language to make sure to provide doctors with the preached freedom they need to exercise their professional judgment with freedom.

Monning, Bill (Legislator) Senate
I'm one of those who feel strongly that the public health interest of all Californians is are in charge and as I said in an earlier hearing striking the balance between individual choice about your own child if that choice can affect the health of somebody else's child then it goes beyond the per view of personal choice and becomes a personal choice with community consequences.

Monning, Bill (Legislator) Senate
My concern, and my trouble with that opposition, is that you're making a choice not just for your child, not just for your family. But a choice that potentially affects another person's child.

Pan, Richard (Legislator) Senate
Who are concerned about going to school, not because of their own choices, because of someone else's choices. And that, so what about the right to those families? To bring their children to school without being at risk of potentially catching a serious disease.

The SB 277 bill has gone through a series of modifications and
amendments during the timeframe of the dataset (the committee
hearings took place on different dates). I am interested in
finding out more about any specific changes the bill, amendments
that the authors wound up including, or any amendments that
might have been discussed regardless of whether or not they
made it into the future versions of the bill.

We can also entertain a motion. And I'm also going to walk through what changed going forward. So everyone's clear about what's happening and where we're going. There's gonna be an additional amendment taken before the assembly floor.

With these amendments and the amendment that will be taken before it gets to the floor, I feel comfortable voting aye on the bill.

I wanna digress just a bit about my change of heart regarding parental choice. A few years ago I was hear to testify on behalf of Dr. Pan's previous bill to increase immunization rates, AB 2109, which has successfully mildly reduced the immunization opt-out rate in California.

No. The vaccine requirements have not been changed in terms of which vaccines are required at what time in this particular bill, it's based on previous actions of this legislature. Every single vaccine that's required in the state of California has been passed by this legislature and signed by a governor.

So again this is a professional judgment but I would say that physicians want to work actually, we actually had a previous discussion about this before you came in that physicians I think, most physicians work with the families, I mean we know the patients we work with the families and we want to help them and make things work out.

In the past, California was extremely generous in providing exemptions from immunization requirements. Before AB 2109 it was even easier than it is now. It still is reasonably easy to get an exemption, but again this balance is something states can and do consider as things change.

At that time, I spoke of my belief in parental rights in this regard. But times change, and my views have evolved. My father-in-law died last year, which prompted much introspection and reflection on his career. Among his other roles, Dr. Jesse Steinfeld served as Surgeon General of the US about 45 years ago.

Yes. This bill is about having your child enroll in school or potentially, the existing law for day care. And it's about enrolling children in school. So a child visiting a doctor would still have to provide. The parent would still have to provide consent before we would immunize a child. That does not change under this bill.

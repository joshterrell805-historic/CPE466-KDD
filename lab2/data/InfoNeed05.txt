The proponents of the SB277 bill often cite
scientific evidence to back their case for the 
bill. I am interested in finding utternaces
in which the speaker expressed doubt in the science
supporting vaccination.

evidence research science doubt not false actually proof claim faulty poor adequate contrary belief oppose against

The fact that science has not adequately defined, who among us is at high risk for vaccine complications, does not mean that our lives are less deserving of protection than those at high risk for the disease complications. The science is not clear, it is not settled.

In both of them, research studies have shown, have been linked to communities with low vaccination rates and high use of personal belief exemptions. This is the proof of why SB 277 is necessary to protect the public from vaccine-preventable contagions.

Vaccines and the policies that require them for school protect our children and our communities. Our organization is not here to debate or defend the science behind vaccines. We are here to insist that science is honored over gut feelings, fear, and baseless claims.

But you can change policy and make it harder for people to fall victim to the traps of bogus claims. In considering SB 277 please remember personal belief exemptions do not save lives. Vaccines save lives. Personal belief exemptions do not protect our children and communities.

Vaccinations have prevented more than 21 million hospitalizations, and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years. Vaccines are safe and vaccines work. The Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences, examined the research and data on vaccine safety and concluded that, quote, there is no evidence of major safety concerns associated with adherence to the childhood immunization schedule, unquote.

I think they probably underreport both because you have to have very fair proof that a person died of a disease and very fair proof that a person died of a vaccine and sometimes the proof is a little tough.

others, that's easy for people who claim personal choice, but we're here for the community. We believe that this is sound public health policy because it keeps our children safe. You have a duty to legislate from solid evidence. not from fear and keep our schools safe. Vaccines save lives, please vote yes on SB 277. Thank you, I now yield to Rhett.

Non-vaccinating families do not pose a unique, or in most cases, any threat to the public to warrant any discrimination against them. My conclusion is that SB 277 is not needed and personal belief exemptions must be preserved. Thank you for your attention.
